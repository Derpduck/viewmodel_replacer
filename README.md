# viewmodel_replacer
SourceMod plugin to replace viewmodels in L4D2, used to revert viewmodels to their original versions, or to use custom viewmodels

The viewmodels provided are the original tier 1 shotgun and SMG models from before The Last Stand Update, which have been recompiled to change the model name.
You can use your own custom viewmodels, provided the file names are not the same as the default models.

Clients must have `cl_allowdownload` set to `1` and `cl_downloadfilter` set to `all` to use any of the functionality of this plugin.
